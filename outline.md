## goals

- create prompt generator
- prompts generate into a card
- users will be able to 'save' prompts (like to a pinboard?) as cards
- users will be able to store their prompts offline for later use
- is this a once a day prompt or can users re-roll prompts/prompt generator?
  - reroll and save cards

## Borrow Smart

Look at zcmag xyz zine idea generator for how they handle indexes of prompts -> could save as a json array or i could not hate myself?
